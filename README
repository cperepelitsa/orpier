ABOUT

This is a simple fork of "orpie" by Paul J. Pelzl <pelzlpj@eecs.umich.edu>
that has been refactored to build with ocamlbuild, findlib, and GNU GSL
and ncurses libraries implemented/wrapped in OCaml.
The modified source is that of orpie v1.5.1.  Most of the code and all
of the documentation has been left intact (including those mysterious
"arch" files), except that the generated man pages are included so that
LaTeX is not needed to build them.

Tests, which did not work in the original orpie-1.5.1, have not been
fixed (TODO?).  Regardless, each test case passes if manually typed into
the compiled binary.

As this is about rescuing the best CLI calculator in existence from bit
rot, there are no plans to update or improve this project.  I will only
accept patches that address bugs I've introduced or licensing issues
I've overlooked.
(But, of course, feel free to fork and modify to your heart's content.)


REQUIREMENTS

Requirements:
  - ocaml
  - ocamlbuild
  - findlib
  - curses (OCaml library)
  - gsl (OCaml library)

(An easy way to fulfill these requirements is to use an OCaml package
manager like OPAM (opam.ocamlpro.com) or GODI (godi.camlcity.org).)

Tested with OCaml 4.00.1, curses 1.0.3, and gsl 1.11.0, though I suspect
it'll work just fine with older versions.


INSTALLATION

Edit the PREFIX and SYSCONFDIR to your liking in the Makefile, then
"make" to compile and (sudo) "make install" to install.
